	performance measures and any positive or negative experiences you had with it 

DIY Physics
X	Creating a scene 
	At least two objects added to the scene which react according to Newton's 3 laws of motion 
X	Demonstrate a force acting on an object 
	Demonstrate one object applying a force to another 
X	Demonstrating collision detection between objects
